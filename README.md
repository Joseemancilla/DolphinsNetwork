# DolphinsNetwork
The dolphin network visualization program is written in R and uses network analysis techniques to visualize the relationships between dolphins in a community. 

To create the visualizations, the program uses data on dolphin interactions, such as observations of play behavior or vocalizations. It then applies network analysis techniques to create graphs that show the connections between individual dolphins. The program can display various types of information about the relationships, such as the strength of the connections or the patterns of interaction between different groups of dolphins.

The program is written in R, making it easy to integrate with other R-based tools and data sources.
